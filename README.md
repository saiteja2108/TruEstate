# TruEstate — Retail Sales Management System

Author: A V S Sai Teja

This repository is a complete full-stack submission for the TruState recruitment challenge.

This project includes:

- `backend/` — Node.js + Express API that loads a CSV dataset and exposes `GET /api/sales`.
- `frontend/` — Vite + React application with TailwindCSS and Framer Motion implementing the Dynamic Data Zones UI.

All run instructions use Windows `cmd.exe` syntax. See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for details.
